        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These baked chicken tenders have a deliciously crispy panko bread crumb coating for that extra crunch factor without the guilt of frying! You can marinate the tenders in light buttermilk in the refrigerator for 1 hour instead of dipping in the beaten egg.</p>        
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken tenders, cut into 1/2-inch strips lengthwise</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. </li>

            <li>Step 3: Dip 2 chicken strips into egg, then place into panko mixture and shake to coat. Place coated chicken pieces onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining chicken. </li>
            <li>Step 4: Spray each chicken tender with cooking spray twice. </li>
            <li>Step 5: Bake tenders in the preheated oven for 7 minutes. Flip and continue to bake on opposite side until no longer pink in the centers, about 7 minutes more. Remove from the oven. </li>
            <li>Step 6: Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. </li>
            <li>Step 7: Broil tenders in the preheated oven for extra crunch, about 1 to 2 minutes more. </li>
        </ol>
