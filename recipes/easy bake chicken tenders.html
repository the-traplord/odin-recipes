        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Crispy pork belly is all the rage, thanks to social media, food bloggers, and celebrity chefs with too much time on their hands. It's a common sight on menus across the land; you can't channel-surf past a food show without seeing it. It also helps that people are no longer terrified to eat a little fat.</p>>        
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound whole pork belly, skin removed</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon smoked paprika, or to taste</li>
            <li>kosher salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>

            <li>Step 2: Season pork belly all over with smoked paprika, salt, and black pepper. Wrap pork in parchment paper; wrap a second time in aluminum foil; wrap a third time in another sheet of aluminum foil. Place pork packet in a baking dish. </li>
            <li>Step 3: Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 6 hours. Let cool in wrappings to room temperature; place cooled packet in the refrigerator and chill for 8 hours to overnight. </li>
            <li>Step 4: Unwrap chilled pork; reserve any rendered fat that falls away when unwrapping pork.  </li>
            <li>Step 5: Cut pork into 6 equal portions. Cut 1/8x1/8-inch slashes in the fat-side of pork. Season with salt. </li>
            <li>Step 6: Heat 2 tablespoons reserved pork fat in a skillet over medium heat. Place pork belly, fat-side down, in hot fat; cook until browned on all sides and heated through, 5 to 10 minutes. </li>
            <li>Step 7: Transfer pork belly to a plate, drizzle with olive oil, and season with pepper. </li>
        </ol>
